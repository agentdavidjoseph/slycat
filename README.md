Slycat
======

This is Slycat - a platform for research into web-based analysis and
visualization for data science.

Slycat is based on three components:

* An HTTP server that can store, index, and analyze your data.
* A web-based interface that you use to pull your data into Slycat, compute
  analyses, and view analysis results. You can use Slycat with any modern,
  standards-compliant browser, including Firefox, Safari, and Chrome.  There is
  no software to install on your workstation.
* A collection of command-line clients that can be used to push data into
  Slycat and control it remotely, if that suits your workflow better.
