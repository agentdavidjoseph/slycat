Dial-A-Cluster
--------------

This directory contains code for the dial-a-cluster plug-in within the
Slycat framework.  Put this code in a directory “dial-a-cluster” under
the “src” directory, which should also contain the “slycat” directory.

Installation
------------

To set-up the plug-in, you must first connect the dial-a-cluster code to
Slycat server.  To do this, you have to point the server to the
"plugin" directory via the /etc/slycat/slycat-web-server-config.ini file.
Once you do that, the model is "registered" with the Slycat server and it knows
where to find the other code (all stored within this directory).

Push Script
-----------

There are two ways to create a new dial-a-cluster model.  There is a push
script you can use called dac-create-model.py (in the plugin/py directory).
The push script can be run from the Slycat server or from a remote client.
To run from a server you use:

$ python dac-create-model.py --model-name “Weather” ../../data/weather —-no-verify

This loads the weather data onto the web server.  To use the push script
from a remote client, you would use something like:

$ python dac-create-model.py --host https://slycat.sandia.gov --no-verify
    --user smartin --marking uur --model-name “weather” --project-name “Weather-DAC”
    ../../data/weather

For this to work you may need to make available some of the slycat source
code (like the web client module).  It also won't work without password authentication
set up on the server.

Wizard
------
To use the wizard UI, you select "Create" within a project and then
"New Dial-A-Cluster Model" from the drop-down.  The wizard can import both
the generic format (as used by the push script, except without ui preferences)
or the PTS format.
