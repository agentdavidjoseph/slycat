This directory contains code for the dial-a-cluster plug-in within the
Slycat framework.  Put this code in a directory “dial-a-cluster” under
the “src” directory, which should also contain the “slycat” directory.

To set-up the plug-in, you must first connect the dial-a-cluster code to
Slycat server.  To do this, you have to point the server to the
"plugin" directory via the /etc/slycat/slycat-web-server-config.ini file.
Once you do that, the model is "registered" with the Slycat server and it knows
where to find the other code (all stored within this directory).  To start a new
dial-a-cluster model, you next need to load data, for example

$ python dac-create-model.py --model-name “weather” ../../data/weather —-no-verify

loads the weather data onto the web server (run this from the plugin/py directory).

To load the data onto the actual slycat server (not one running in docker), you 
have to run something like:

$ python dac-create-model.py --host https://slycat.sandia.gov --no-verify
    --user smartin --marking uur --model-name “weather” --project-name “Weather-DAC”
    ../../data/weather

For this to work you may need to make available some of the slycat source
code (like the web client module).
