Welcome!
========

This is Slycat - a web-based data science analysis and visualization platform,
created at [Sandia National Laboratories](http://www.sandia.gov).

The goal of the Slycat project is to develop the processes, tools and
techniques to support data science, particularly analysis of large,
high-dimensional data.

# Design

Slycat incorporates several components:

* A Web Server that can load, transform, index, and analyze moderate amounts of data, storing the analysis results for later visualization.
* A web-based user interface that you use to pull your data into the Slycat Web Server, compute analyses, and view analysis results. You can use Slycat with any modern, standards-compliant browser, including Firefox, Safari, and Chrome.  There is no software to install on your workstation.
* A collection of command-line clients that can be used to push data into Slycat Web Server and control it remotely, if that suits your workflow better.

The Slycat Web Server provides easy collaboration and a graphical user
interface for analyses that have broad appeal.
