Overview
========

Slycat™ is a web-based system for performing data analysis and visualization of remote, high-dimensional data.  
In particular, Slycat™ focuses on ensemble data, where an ensemble is a collection of related data sets that are
typically produced as a suite of simulation runs, such as a parameter study.  An ensemble can be 
conceptualized as a set of samples, each sharing a common set of variables and each describing a single point in a 
shared high-dimensional space. Ensemble analysis looks at the combined behaviors and features of the group 
in an effort to understand and describe the underlying problem domain.  

The Slycat™ system integrates data management, scalable analysis, and visualization via commodity web clients using 
a multi-tiered hierarchy of computation and data storage.  Our goal is to operate on data as close to the source as
possible, thereby reducing time and storage costs associated with data movement.  Consequently, we are working to
develop parallel analysis capabilities that operate remotely on High Performance Computing (HPC) platforms, or to
explore algorithms that share calculations between an HPC and our server.  The resulting analysis models are then
stored in a project database on the Slycat™ server and visualized through ordinary web browsers on the users’ 
desktop.  Additional capabilities include retrieval and viewing of images and videos stored on the HPC,
interactive manipulation of linked views in the browser, and collaborative sharing of Slycat™ analysis models.

Why Slycat™?
------------
We run thousands of related simulations to sample a shared problem space (an ensemble), but we cannot interpret 
our results without scalable tools that view the ensemble as a whole.
