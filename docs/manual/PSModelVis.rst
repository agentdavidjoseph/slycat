Parameter Space Model Visualization
-----------------------------------

As shown below, the Parameter Space model page consists of linked scatterplot and data table views, combined with interactive 
filtering, data manipulation, and remote viewing of images and other media.  The *Scatterplot View* provides an abstract 
representation of the ensemble members and their value distributions within the variables selected for the axes. The 
*Variable Table* provides the raw data values contained in the original table file.  Changes made to the plot or the table will 
cause corresponding changes in the other.
