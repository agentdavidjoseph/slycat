Dendrogram Visibility Filtering
-------------------------------

The dendrogram also acts as a visibility filter to select which lines are shown in the Simulation View and which rows appear 
in the Variable Table.  Click on the purple dot representing any node (or the dot at the tip of a subtree triangle) to 
restrict visibility to the leaf nodes associated with that subset of the tree.  Non-visible nodes are grayed out.  Figure 61 
and Figure 62 show the results of limiting visibility to the subtrees of the upper and lower halves of the dendrogram, 
respectively.  These examples clearly demonstrate that the upper and lower subtrees are grouping the results generated by 
input differences in the variable x23 into two categories.  Inputs of -1 (color-coded blue) start higher on the y-axis and 
escalate slowly over a longer time period before peaking, while 0 and 1 (white and red, respectively) start lower on the 
y-axis and peak more rapidly.  These two groups have distinctly different characteristics, which the analysis has captured.
