Projects
--------

Project-specific information consists of the project name, a list of project members, a set of models, and a set of saved 
bookmarks for models within that project. 

Project Creation
================

Projects are created by clicking the green *Create* button on the main Projects page and selecting *New Project* from the dropdown 
that appears.  A dialog will pop up, providing editable regions for you to enter a *Name* and an optional *Description*.  This
brief text field allows you to provide more detailed comments or notes beyond the project name.  Clicking the *Finish* button in 
the lower right corner creates the project and takes you to the newly created project page; clicking the *Cancel* button in 
the lower left corner aborts project creation.

Once the project is created, you will find yourself on the empty project page.  As the project creator, you are automatically 
assigned the role of *Administrator* for that project (although there can be multiple project members with Administrator roles). 
A series of buttons appears to the right of the project name.  Since you have an Administrator role, there will initially be four 
buttons: *Create, Edit, Info,* and *Delete*. Only project administrators can edit or delete the project.  Otherwise, there will 
only be two buttons: *Create* and *Info*.

Editing Projects
================

Clicking on the yellow *Edit* button on a project page and selecting *Edit Project* from the dropdown list provides a means to 
change the project *Name, Description,* or project *Members*.  An *Edit Project* popup will appear with the current project 
information (Figure 6).  In a newly created project, the membership list consists solely of the project creator assigned the role 
of *Administrator*.  The username of the creator will be shown within a red button (buttons are color-coded according to role and 
red is used for an *Administrator*) at the bottom.
