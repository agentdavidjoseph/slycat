Point Focus Selection
=====================

Sometimes it is useful to be able to distinguish one point within a designated set.  This is known as focus selection.  
Clicking one of the previously selected points from within a set will cause that point and its corresponding representations 
in all views to be highlighted in black.  The point is redrawn with a bolded black outline, the corresponding line is drawn 
in black in all three plots, and the background of the pointâ€™s corresponding row in the table is rendered in black.  Selecting 
the point for the city of Chandler from the *red* set in Figure 26, produces the black highlights shown in Figure 27.  This 
*black* highlighting feature is limited to a single point at a time.  Focus selection operates as a toggle switch.  Clicking on 
the point again will remove the *black* highlighting.  Clicking on different point (within the colored sets) will shift the 
black highlight to that new point.

Focus selection works in all of the *Scatterplot*, *Metadata Table*, and *Time Series Plot* panes.  In other words, you can 
select either a *red*, *green*, or *blue* selected point in the *Scatterplot*; a *red*, *green*, or *blue* selected row in the 
*Metadata Table*; or a *red*, *green*, or *blue* line in the *Time Series Plot*.  In each case, the corresponding point, table 
row, or plot will be highlighted in *black(.  (See also Plot Focus Selection and Table Row Selection.)
