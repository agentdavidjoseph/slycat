Temporal Variables
==================

The first dialog you will see upon launching the Model Preferences wizard is shown in Figure 50.  This dialog 
allows the user to display only the variables of interest.  Other variables will not be shown in the *Sliders* 
pane, and the corresponding sliders will be set to zero.  Additionally, those variables will not be displayed in 
the *Time Series Plots* variable selection dropdowns (see Figure 31).

The variables are not in fact removed from the model, however, only hidden to provide a less cumbersome interface.  
By revisiting this dialog, you can re-display variables that were previously hidden.  Once the desired variables 
to display are selected, press the *Continue* button.
