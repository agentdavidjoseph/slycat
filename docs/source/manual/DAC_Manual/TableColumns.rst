Table Columns
=============

In addition to selecting variables to display in the *Sliders* pane and *Time Series Plots*, you can also select 
the columns in the *Metadata Table* that you would like to display.  The dialog for selecting columns in the 
*Metadata Table* is shown in Figure 51.  By hiding columns, you can create a smaller metadata table.  The hidden 
columns will also be unseen in the color selection pulldown above the Scatterplot (see Figure 20).

As in the case of hidden variables, columns are not in fact removed from the model.  They are only hidden to provide 
a less cumbersome interface.  By revisiting the column selection dialog, you can re-display columns that were previously 
hidden.  Once the desired columns to display are selected, press the *Continue* button.
