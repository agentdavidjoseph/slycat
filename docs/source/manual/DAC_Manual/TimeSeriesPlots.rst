   **Figure 14: Initial DAC model configuration for the Weather Data.**

As shown in Figure 14, the Time Series Plots are initially empty.  Once point sets have been selected (see :ref:`SelectingPointSets`), 
plots of the first three temporal variables (as listed in the Sliders view) are generated for the selected points.  An example plot is 
shown in Figure 30.
