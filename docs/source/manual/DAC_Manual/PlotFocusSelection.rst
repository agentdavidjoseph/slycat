.. _PlotFocusSelection:

Plot Focus Selection
====================

Just as we can highlight points in selected sets by clicking on them in either the *Scatterplot* or the *Metadata Table*, we can also select 
them from within a *Time Series Plot*.  As your mouse cursor crosses into the rectangle defined by the plot axes, the cursor changes from an 
arrow to a cross.  However, as the cursor moves over a line, it changes back to an arrow.  This signals that the line under the tip of the 
arrow can be selected by clicking.  If you click, the line is then highlighted in black, as is the corresponding *Scatterplot* point and the 
corresponding *Metadata Table* row.  *Focus selection* is a toggle, so clicking a second time acts to de-focus the line, point, and row.  (See 
also :ref:`PointFocusSelection` and :ref:`TableRowSelection`.)
