Subset Analysis
===============

If you want to restrict your analysis to a subset of the points, click the   icon (as shown in Figure 28), then select the point subset by a click-and-drag rubber-band operation to generate a shaded rectangular region that encompasses the desired points.  Releasing the mouse button completes the selection, regenerates the MDS projection based on the reduced point set, and redraws the scatterplot.  The icon is now yellowed   , indicating that the currently rendered scatterplot is a subset.  Click anywhere in the background to return to the full point set.
Alternatively, a point or points may be excluded from the subset by holding the shift key and then clicking on the point that is to be excluded.  Multiple points may be excluded by holding the shift key while using rubber-band operation.
