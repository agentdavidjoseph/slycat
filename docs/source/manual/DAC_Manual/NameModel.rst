.. _NameModel:

Name Model
==========

Once the data format and input parameters have been obtained, the DAC import wizard allows you to name the new DAC model.  
As shown in Figure 11, the *Name Model* tab has three fields: *Name*, *Description*, and *Marking*.  This allows you to 
specify a unique and meaningful name for the model, an optional short textual description (perhaps aspects of the data used 
to generate the model, or parameter choices made when creating it), and optional markings.  The marking selections provided 
in the dropdown list are site-specific for the Slycat™ server you are accessing.

   **Figure 11: In the Name Model tab there are three fields: Name, Description, and a Marking dropdown list.**

Once you have completed entering this information, click the *Finish & Go To Model* button in the lower right to complete the 
DAC model creation process.  The system will now start to upload the input files.

If the model name and/or markings need to be changed after the model has been loaded, that can be performed using the 
*Edit > Model Name & Info* pulldown in the upper right of the Slycat™ window.
