The *Locate Data* tab for the Dial-A-Cluster Generic Format provides a local file browser for uploading the 
zip file from your desktop, or shared drive (see :ref:`DACGenericFormat` for details on the formatting 
of the generic zip file contents).  First, click *Browse* in the *Locate Data* tab shown in Figure 6, then 
using the popup file browser, navigate to the location of the zip file and select it.  Press *Continue* to 
advance to the *Name Model* tab.
