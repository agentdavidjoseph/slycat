Table Sorting
=============

The rows in the *Metadata Table* can be sorted using the column headers simply by clicking on the column headers.  
If the full header is truncated (e.g. Latitu â€¦), the full column name can be viewed by hovering over the column 
header, or column can be resized.

If a table is sorted, the table export button (see :ref:`DownloadDataTable`) will order the exported table rows 
in the sorted order.
