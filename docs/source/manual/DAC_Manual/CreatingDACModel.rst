Model Creation
==============

To create a DAC model within Slycat™, click the green *Create* button in the Navbar while you are on a project page.  
A dropdown menu will appear as shown in Figure 4.  Note that DAC models are only generated from data sets stored locally 
on your desktop machine, or on a shared disk accessible from your desktop.  Unlike other Slycat™ models, there is no 
remote data option for ingestion of data sets stored on a cluster.
