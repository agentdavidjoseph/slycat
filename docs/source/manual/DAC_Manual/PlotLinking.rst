Plot Linking
============

In the upper left of each time series plot there is a *Link* checkbox.  These checkboxes allow the user to perform the same operation on 
multiple plots simultaneously.  For example, if the user links all three plots, then uses zoom in the first plot, each of the other plots 
will be zoomed to the same scale.  In addition, a vertical line indicating the cursor position, normally shown in each individual plot, is 
duplicated on any linked plots.  Two linked plots are shown in Figure 33.

   **Figure 33: Linked plots, both zoomed to the same scale.  The userâ€™s cursor position is shown as a vertical line, replicated in both linked plots.**

In order to link plots, the time scale (x-axis) must be identical in the plots to be linked.  If the scales are not identical, an error 
message will be displayed and the plots will not be linked.
