In addition to manually selecting variables for the plots, the plots for all of the temporal variables can be automatically ordered to 
maximize the difference between the selections by clicking |DiffIcon|.  The ordered plots can then be viewed three at a time, paging forward or 
backward using the |DiffBackIcon| and |DiffForwardIcon| buttons, respectively.  If the selections change and the ordering is no longer valid, 
the order icon alerts the user by turning yellow |DiffWarnIcon|.
