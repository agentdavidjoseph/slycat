Selecting Point Sets 
====================

Thus far, we have explored similarities between ensemble members through their proximity in the abstract space of the 
*Scatterplot*.  However, exploring and comparing temporally changing variables requires comparison of the underlying time 
series data.  DAC does this for small sets of points using plots showing variable values over time to reveal temporal patterns.  

Using the Scatterplot, we identify potentially interesting sets of points to view as *Time Series Plots*.  Up to three sets 
of points can be defined at one time.  The points of each set are rendered with color-coded borders (red, blue, and green).  
Points retain their fill color, which encodes a pointâ€™s value for the selected metavariable (see the previous section, 
Metadata Color-Coding).
