Plot Variable Selection
=======================

The field in the upper right shows the name of the temporal variable being plotted.  Although only three variables may be plotted at a 
time, you can select which variables you wish to see.  Clicking the variable label pulldown displays a list of the temporal variables 
available, as shown in Figure 31.  In the list, the currently selected variable is marked with a check.  Change the plot to display a 
different variable by selecting it from the list.
