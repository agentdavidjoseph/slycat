   **Figure 49: Edit Model Preferences pulldown menu.**

There are various parameters that are used to calibrate the DAC user interface experience and performance.  These 
parameters can be adjusted to tune the interface according to preference.  The parameters can be changed using the 
model preferences wizard, accessible under the Edit > Model Preferences pulldown menu, as shown in Figure 49.  The 
model preferences are stored separately for each model so are adjusted on a per model basis. In other words, use 
Edit > Model Preferences from the model you are interested in tuning.
