Weather Example Data Set
========================

In this manual, we use a weather data set to illustrate model creation and DAC in general.  
The weather dataset is not an ensemble of simulation outputs.  Instead it is a set of 
measured values of various temporally-changing weather-related quantities, such as 
temperature, dew point, humidity, sea level pressure, visibility, wind speed, precipitation, 
cloud cover, and wind direction collected during 2014 for 100 cities in the United States 
from Weather Underground (http://www.wunderground.com).  The number of samples in each of the time 
series are all identical, each consisting of a value per day for a little more than a year.  
In addition to the temporal variables, each city has associated meta data, including city 
name, state, time zone, population, latitude, longitude, average temperature, average 
humidity, annual precipitation, average wind speed, average visibility, and average cloud 
cover.
