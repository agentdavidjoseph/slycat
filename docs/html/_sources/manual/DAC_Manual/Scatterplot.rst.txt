Scatterplot
===========

Distances between points indicate similarity, with closer points being more similar.  Initially, all temporal variables are 
fully weighted, so the MDS point projection gives equal importance to all temporal variables in calculating point proximity.  

Note that dimensionality reduction from a high-dimensional space down to two dimensions generally does not completely capture 
the distance relationships found in the higher-dimensional space due to the limitations of the lower-dimensional embedding.
