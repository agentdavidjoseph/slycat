Scatterplot Zoom |ZoomIcon|
===========================

Alternatively, you may need to simply zoom in on a subset of points to see a region of the broader analysis set in more detail.  Click on the 
|ZoomIcon2| icon shown in Figure 29, then select a region within the *Scatterplot* by clicking and holding the mouse button until the shaded 
region defines the area to be zoomed.  Releasing the mouse button redraws the selected region, scaling point positions to fill the *Scatterplot* 
view.  The icon is now yellowed |ZoomIconYellow|, indicating that the view is zoomed.  Zooming in further can be accomplished by repeating the 
zoom selection process.  At any point, you can return to the originally scaled view by clicking anywhere in the background.

Unlike the analysis subset operation, set membership remains constant, irrespective of whether selected points are visible in the zoom or not.  
Consequently, the *Time Series Plots* and the *Metadata Table* rows do not change in response to zooming.
