slycat-server-root Module
=========================

Like any web service, the Slycat server could be deployed behind a reverse
proxy, altering the URLs used by a client to access the :ref:`rest-api`.  For
example, if an organization deployed an instance of Slycat at
`http://example.com/services/slycat`, clients would need to get
`/services/slycat/projects` to retrieve the list of available projects instead
of the default `/projects`.

To facilitate this, the slycat-server-root module defines a single constant
string - the server root - which *must* be prepended to all URLs generated by
clients.  For example, clients should never use hard-coded URLs:

.. code-block:: js

  jquery.ajax("/projects"); // DON'T DO THIS

Instead, the server root must be used to build the URL dynamically at runtime:

.. code-block:: js

  require(["slycat-server-root"], function(server_root)
  {
    jquery.ajax(server_root + "projects");
  });
